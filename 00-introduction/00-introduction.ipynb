    "## Scope and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this book, you will be able to do exploratory data analysis on a dataset, evaluate potential machine learning solutions, implement, and evaluate them.\n",
    "The focus of the book is on tried-and-true methodology for solving real-world machine learning problems. However, we will not go into the details of productionizing and deloying the solutions.\n",
    "We will mostly focus on what's know as tabular data, i.e. data that would usually be represented as a pandas DataFrame, Excel Spreadsheet, or CSV file. While we will discuss working with text-data in Chapter, there are many more advanced techniques, for which I'll point you towards [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J. Smola.\n",
    "We will not look at image recognition, video or speech data, or time series forecasting, though many of the core concepts described in this book will also apply there."

    "## What is machine learning?\n",
    "Machine learning, also known as predictive modeling in statistics, is a research field and a collection of techniques to extract knowledge from data, often used to automate decision-making processes. Applications of machine learning are pervasive in technology, in particular in complex websites such as facebook, Amazon, youtube or Google. These sites use machine learning to personalize the experience, show relevant content, decide on advertisements, and much more. Without machine learning, none of these services would look anything like they do today.\n",
    "Outside the web, machine learning has also become integral to commercial applications in manifacturing, logistics, material design, financial markets and many more. Finally, over the last years, machine learning has also become essential to research in practically all data-driven sciences, including physics, astronomy, biology, medicine, earth sciences and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main sub-areas of machine learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each of which applies to a somewhat different setting. We'll discuss each in turn, and give some examples of how they can be used."

    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is by far the most commonly used in practice. In supervised learning, a model is built from a dataset of input-output pairs, where the input is known as features or independent variables, which we'll denote by $x$, and the output is known as target or label, which we'll denote by $y$. The input here is a representation of an entity of interest, say a customer to your online shop, represented by their age, location and shopping history. The output is a quantity of interest that we want our model to predict, say whether they would buy a particular product if we recommend it to them. To build a model, we need to collect many such pair, i.e. we need to build records of many customers and their decisions about whether or not they bought the product after an recommendation was shown to them. Such a set of input-output pairs for the purpose of building a supervised machine learning model is called a *training set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "(customers of bank easier? because discrete products?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we collected this dataset, we can (attempt to) build a supervised machine learning model that will make a prediction for a new user that wasn't included in the training dataset. That might enable us to make better recommendations, i.e. only show recommendations to a user that's likely to buy.\n",
    "(given an example?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The name supervised learning comes from the fact that during learning, the dataset contains the correct targets, which acts as a supervisor for the model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Mathematical Background\n",
    "From a mathematical standpoint, supervised learning assumes that there is a joint distribution $p(x, y)$ and that the training dataset consists for independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from this joint distribution.\n",
    "The model is then applied to new data sampled from the same distribution, but $y$ is unknown. The model is then used to estimate $p(y | x)$, or more commonly the mode of this distribution, i.e. the most likely value for $y$ to take given the $x$ we observed.\n",
    "In the case of learning to predict a coin flip, you could actually learn a very accurate model of $p(y | x)$, that predicts heads and tails with equal probability. There is no way to predict the particular outcome itself, though.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For both regression and classification, it’s important to keep in mind the concept of generalization. Let’s say we have a regression task. We have features, that is data vectors x_i and targets y_i drawn from a joint distribution. We now want to learn a function f, such that f(x) is approximately y, not on this training data, but on new data drawn from this distribution. This is what’s called generalization, and this is a core distinction to function approximation. In principle we don’t care about how well we do on x_i, we only care how well we do on new samples from the distribution. We’ll go into much more detail about generalization in about a week, when we dive into supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification and Regression\n",
    "So getting back to supervised learning, there are two basic kinds, called classification and regression. The difference is quite simple: if y is continuous, then it’s regression, and if y is discrete, it’s classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's simple, let me give an example. If I want to predict whether a one of you will pass the class, it’s a classification problem. There are two possible answers, “yes” and “no”. If I want to predict how many points you get on an exam, it’s a regression problem, there is a continuous, gradual output space.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generalizations of this where we try to predict more than one variable, but we won’t go into that in this course. The main reason the distinction between classification and regression is important is because the way we measure how good a prediction is is very different for the two. It's not always entirely clear whether it's best to formulate a problem as classification or regression. If you think of predicting a 5-star rating, there's only 5 different possible outcomes, so you might think it's classification. But there is also an obvious ordering between the outcomes, which would make it a regression problem. Both formulations could work, and there are approaches that combine the two for this particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalization\n",
    "For both regression and classification, it’s important to keep in mind the concept of generalization. Let’s say we have a regression task. We have features, that is data vectors x_i and targets y_i drawn from a joint distribution. We now want to learn a function f, such that f(x) is approximately y, not on this training data, but on new data drawn from this distribution. This is what’s called generalization, and this is a core distinction to function approximation. In principle we don’t care about how well we do on x_i, we only care how well we do on new samples from the distribution. We’ll go into much more detail about generalization in about a week, when we dive into supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For supervised learning to work, some key assumptions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **the necessary information for making the correct prediction actually needs to be encoded in the training data**. For example, if I try to learn to predict a fair coin flip before the coin is tossed, it's unlikely for me to build a working machine learning model, no matter what I choose as the input. The process is very (or entirely?) random, and the information to make a prediction is just not available.\n",
    "In other cases, a prediction might be possible in principle, but we might not have provided the right information to the model. For example, it might be possible for a machine learning model to learn to diagnose pneumonia in a patient, but not if the only information about the patient that we represent to them is their shopping habbits and wardrobe. If we use a chest x-ray as a representation of the patient, together with a collection of symptoms, we will likely have better success.\n",
    "Even if the information is represented in the input, learning might still fail if the model is unable to extract the information. For example, visual stimuli are very easy to interpret for humans, but in general much harder to understand for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "Consequently, it would be much harder for a machine to determine if a graffiti is offensive, than if the same information was represented as a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the \n",
    "\n",
    "- cover variability\n",
    "- i.i.d samples in test set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "Here are some examples of supervised learning. Given an array of test results from a patient, does this patient have diabetes? The x_i would be the different test results, and y_i would be diabetes or no diabetes. Given a piece of a satellite image, what is the terrain in this image? Here x_i would be the pixels of the image, and y_i would be the terrain types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often used to automate manual labor. For example, you might annotate part of a dataset manually, then learn a machine learning model from this annotations, and use the model to annotate the rest of your data."

    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "In unsupervised machine learning, we are just given data points x_i, that are assumed to be drawn from an unknown distribution. Usually we want to learn something about these, such as whether they lie on a low-dimensional subspace, or whether the data clusters in several groups, or find ways to represent the distribution compactly. The goal in unsupervised learning is often much less clear than in supervised learning, and there is no-one providing a “correct” answers and no supervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of unsupervised learning is discovering topics in news articles or on twitter, or grouping data into clusters for easier analysis. Another one is outlier detection, where you ask “does this data look normal” which is important for fraud detection and security systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "The third kind, reinforcement learning, has been in the news quite a bit in the last year. Has anyone heard of that? Alpha go beat the world champion in go. Reinforcement learning is about an agent learning to interact with an environment, with some ultimate goal. The environment could be a go board, and the goal to win the game. For self-driving cars, the the environment could be roads, sensed by cameras and laser sensors, and the goal would be to get you somewhere quickly and safely. Or, the environment could be a social media platform, and the goal could be to provide you such great content that you never remove your eyes from your phone again!\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is quite different in that you usually don’t work with a dataset – you work with a whole world. This can be a video game, a simulation, or the real world. The actions of the agent influence which part of the world they see and which situations they encounter, and it’s usually impossible to look at all possible situations, even for something as limited as a go board. This means in reinforcement learning you can not separate data collection and learning, which you can do for unsupervised and supervised learning. There will be no reinforcement learning in this class, as the techniques are quite different, and real-world use of this technique is still quite limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have notices in the table of contents, this book mostly concerns itself with supervised and unsupervised learning, and we will not discuss reinforcement learning any further.\n",
    "As a matter of fact, the book heavily emphasizes supervised learning, which has found the larges success among the three in practical applications so far.\n",
    "While all three of these areas are interesting in their own right, when you see an application of machine learning, or when someone says they are using machine learning for something,\n",
    "chances are they mean supervised learning, which is arguably the most well-understood, and the most easy to productionize and analyze. "

    "### Isn't this just statistics?\n",
    "Before I’ll go into some general principles, I want to position machine learning in relation to statistics. I recently got chewed out by a colleague for doing that. My goal here is not to say one is better than the other. Actually, there’s really no clear boundary between statistics and machine learning, and anyone that tells you otherwise is lying. Two of the books I recommended for the course are actually statistics text books. But I can tell you how the tools that I’m talking about in this course will differ from what you’d learn in a typical stats course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is usually about inference, often phrased in terms of hypothesis testing. An example might be a yes-no-question, such as “are women less likely to enroll in a Data Science Program”, and you have a sample population, for example this classroom, and you can then try to make an inference about whether this statement is true. Often this includes making assumptions on how your sample relates to the general population, say this class vs all of DSI or Columbia vs all of the US. You might also have a specific model of how the process behind your question works.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, machine learning is about prediction and generalization. We want to learn from past data to predict outcomes on future, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually want to make statements about individual data points, and we want to build a model that will work on new data that fulfills our assumptions, independent of the population we samples. Often we don’t have or need a model of the process, but we rely on the assumption that our training data is generated from the same process as any future data will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are statisticians that do predictions and there are machine learning scientists that do inference, but I find this distinction helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again I’m not saying one or the other is better, I’m just saying that you should know what kind of problem you are trying to solve, and what the right tool for the problem is. And then you can call it machine learning or statistics or probabilistic inference or data science. The tools you learn in this class will usually not help you to make yes/no inferences, and they will only give you a limited insight into the data generating process."

    "## When to use and not to use machine learning\n",
    "My first advice would be, don’t try machine learning. Machine learning systems are very complex and often fragile. Whether you’re in research or a startup, don’t immediately start with \"oh we can apply deep learning to this\". Often it’s good to collect data, and be able to use data to drive and evaluate decisions. But including a complex process like machine learning into whatever you’re trying to do will make it much harder to debug and much harder to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The role of data\n",
    "Clearly the data you use for building and applying machine learning systems is a critical component, and we will talk a lot about handling and transforming data this semester. Clearly, if you don’t have data, you can’t use machine learning. Let’s say you have a dataset. A very important question you need to ask yourself is: should I get more data? That’s another reason why kaggle competitions are bad: usually you can’t get more data. So what do you think? Should you get more data? More data always improves the model if it’s from the right source. So it depends: What’s the marginal cost of more data, what’s the marginal benefit to the model, what’s the marginal benefit of the model to your end-goal? We will talk about how to assess the benefit to the model later in the course. But the other questions are also important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of data can be very different, and two kinds of data are particularly common: free data, and very expensive data. What kind of data do you think is free?\n",
    "\n",
    "Free data is data that you’ll just get more of. And that happens a lot. If you are running an ad company and want to do click prediction, every day you’ll get so much new data, you’ll barely be able to use it all. The same is true for the stock-market. In general, if you want to predict the future, and the event is observable, you’ll get more data just by waiting. This can either be because the world just produces the data, or your business process produces them. You can also be smart, and ensure your business is set up in a way so that it does produce the data. Google used captchas to do OCR and to read house numbers, then they used the results for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other extreme of the spectrum is when you want to automate an expensive process with machine learning. This process could be an expert opinion, like a doctor’s diagnosis, or a literary analysis. It could also be an experiment, like an initial drug-trial, or measuring the efficiency of a microchip."

    "## Metrics and evaluation\n",
    "One of the most important parts of machine learning is defining the goal, and defining a way to measure that goal. In this way, Kaggle is a really bad way to prepare you for machine learning in the real world, because they already did that work for you. In the real world, people don’t tell you whether you should use unsupervised learning, supervised learning, classification or regression, and what’s the right way to cast something as a machine learning task – or whether to cast it as machine learning at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "So think in context of your problem. What do you want to achieve? What is the easiest way to achieve this? And what will improving over this baseline buy you?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of metrics is not unique to machine learning, but a problem in any data driven decision making. And often you have no choice but to use a substitute metric, either because the effect you’re interested in is too hard to measure, or because the influence is too indirect. Imagine spotify improved their artist radio to be waaay better. The metric they care about is revenue. Do you think better radio will increase revenue short-term? What would be a good substitute metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say facebook wants to optimize their ad revenue. What should they measure? If people click on ads, that's probably good, right? But you can optimize clicks on ads by increasing accidental clicks by putting ads next to things people click. But accidental clicks will not yield conversions, and if you sell clicks to the ad buyers, and they don't result in conversions, they will go somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethics\n",
    "One aspect of machine learning that only recently is getting some more attention is ethics. There was a recent article in propublica about racial bias in risk-assessment used in the criminal justice system. Spoiler alert: it’s bad. I recommend reading the article, it’s quite interesting. This is a black-box machine learning system created by some company. If they had to provide explanations, or a more transparent system, the situation would likely be better. But this is not the only place where ethics plays a role in machine learning. There will be a more focused course on ethics in the DSI next semester, and I really recommend looking into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people think that ethics is not something that the technical people should care about, but I disagree. I think if you build a machine learning system, you should know whether and how it is biased, and whether its application is ethical. Sometimes it’s hard to decide that, though. There’s an example of two high-schools, both of whom tried to predict which of their students will underperform in the coming year. There is a lot of ways this could be biased based on race, financial background and other factors. But that’s not the point. The point is that one of the schools used the predictions, and kicked out these students before the annual evaluation, so that they got a better evaluation score. The other school used the data to provide these students with targeted support and help. The algorithm could be the same, but the outcome is quite different. Ok, that’s enough about ethics, I hope you’ll keep these considerations in mind. The next thing I want to talk about is data!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explainable AI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling up\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s another aspect to data collection and dataset size. More data might be more expensive to collect, but it might also be more expensive and more complicated to work with. With the available cloud services, storage might not be that much of an issue any more. But runtime is. And I’m less concerned about buying a bigger cluster, I’m more concerned about your time, the data scientists time and the machine learning analysis. There’s a reason we’ll be using Python in this course. Python is easy to learn, has lots of tools and allows very close interactions with the data. If we would try to use SPARK instead, this would be whole other story. Working with distributed systems is hard, they are not responsive and the tooling is often not as good. So what I often do, no matter how big the dataset is, is to work with a subset of the data that fits into my RAM. Then I can use python, and everything is easy. And with AWS, I can easily get 512GB of RAM, if I really need to. Arguably I'm a bit biased because I work on scikit-learn. For some applications that subsampling might not make sense, or working on very large data is critical. But I don't think that should ever be the first step."
