Welcome
============================
Welcome to Applied Machine Learning with Python.
This is a draft of an in-depth guide to machine learning in Python with scikit-learn.

It's based on my lecture on Applied Machine Learning.

The book is available online at ...
and all notebooks are available on github.

Please feel free to open issues and pull requests there to improve the book.

This book is aimed at practitioners that have some experience with Python, but not necessarily a strong mathematical background.
Therefore, I tried to avoid going into too much detail on the mathematical details of particular methods.
I highly recommend the books ESL and Kevin Murphy for those that are interested.

This is an early draft, and feedback is very welcome!
It's based on scikit-learn 0.23, though might require some features of scikit-learn 0.24 when finished.
