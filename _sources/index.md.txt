Welcome
============================
Welcome to Applied Machine Learning with Python.
This is a draft of an in-depth guide to machine learning in Python with scikit-learn.

It's based on my course on [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/andreasmueller) that I held at Columbia.

The book is available online at [https://amueller.github.io/aml](https://amueller.github.io/aml).
and all notebooks are available on [github](https://github.com/amueller/aml).

Please feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/amueller/aml/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/amueller/aml/pulls) there to improve the book.

This book is aimed at practitioners that have some experience with Python, but not necessarily a strong mathematical background.
Therefore, I tried to avoid going into too much detail on the mathematical details of particular methods.
I highly recommend the book [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman and [Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) Kevin Murphy for those that are interested.


```{admonition} Mathematical Background
In some places, there are side-notes with mathematical details where those can be helpful for understanding the materials.
However, these parts are optional and not required to follow the main text.
```

This is an early draft, and feedback is very welcome!
It's based on scikit-learn 0.23, though might require some features of scikit-learn 0.24 when finished.
