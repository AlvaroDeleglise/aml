    "“Because that's how you get ants.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The bag of word representation is implemented in the count\n",
    "vectorizer in scikit-learn, which is a\n",
    "sklearn.feature_extraction.text\n",

    "strings as input, not numeric data. Usually, transformers\n",
    "take in a Numpy area as anything in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here, count vectorizer takes in a list of strings. I\n",

    "entries from ‘ants’ to ‘you’. So if I use this count\n",

    "\n",
    "I can use this to transform the 2 documents that I have. X\n",

    "something or miss typing something or using names or\n",
    "something like that.\n",
    "\n",
